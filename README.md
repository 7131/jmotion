# jmotion

jmotion is a JavaScript library for running juggling simulator on the web.
You can easily execute animation by specifying "siteswap", which is a numerical sequence that represents the juggling pattern, or you can control its part by directly specifying the coordinates of graphic elements.

See the directory by version.
